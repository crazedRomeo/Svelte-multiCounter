# Svelte Countdown App

This is a simple countdown app built using Svelte. It allows users to specify a time interval and then count down from it.

## Getting Started

To run this app on your local machine, you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rodrigodagostino/svelte-countdown-app.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd svelte-countdown-app
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The app should now be running on http://localhost:5173.

## Usage

To use the app, simply specify your desired time interval by using the **Up** and **Down** buttons or typing in the numbers on each field. Then press the **Play** button to start the timer. You can pause the timer by pressing the **Play** button once again, which will now be showing a **Pause** icon. To reset the count, press the **Reset** button next to **Play**.
